Codelab for Implementing a Helpdesk Chatbot with Dialogflow & BigQuery ML
============

This repository contains the code for the Implementing a Helpdesk Chatbot with Dialogflow & BigQuery ML codelab:
* [Implementing a Helpdesk Chatbot with Dialogflow & BigQuery ML codelab](https://g.co/codelabs/cloud-dialogflow-bqml)

Introduction
------------
Wouldn’t it be awesome to have an accurate estimate of how long it will take for tech support to resolve your issue? In this lab you will train a simple machine learning model for predicting helpdesk response time using BigQuery Machine Learning.  You will then build a simple chatbot using Dialogflow and learn how to integrate your trained BigQuery ML model with your helpdesk chatbot. The final solution will provide an estimate of response time to users at the moment a request is generated!

Prerequisites
--------------
* Basics concepts and constructs of Dialogflow. [Click here](https://dialogflow.com/docs/tutorial-build-an-agent) for an introductory Dialogflow tutorial that covers basic conversational design and fulfillment using a webhook.
* Basic SQL and Node.js (or any coding language) knowledge.

Getting Started
---------------
Visit the Google Codelabs site to follow along the guided steps.

What is Included Here?
---------------
* The ml-helpdesk-bot.zip file can be imported into a Dialogflow agent. It will copy intents and entities for a simple helpdesk chatbot.
* The index.js and package.json files can be used to create a Dialogflow fulfillment that integrates with BigQuery.
